ceng478_hw2
-----------
In this homework, a matrix-vector product is implemented using Intel MKL BLAS routines in two different ways. In the first method(ceng478_hw2_hor.c), matrix is shared between parallel processes horizontally and in the second method (ceng478_hw2_ver.c), vertically. Finally, Euclidean norm of the resulting vector is calculated. Algorithms are run using different number of processes and results are observed.
